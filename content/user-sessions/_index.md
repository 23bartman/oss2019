In addition to Working Sessions this year we are also introducing the concept of User Sessions, which will be very learning-based hands-on practically-driven sessions, so you leave with the knowledge, skills and tools you need to make immediate changes in your workplace.

We wanted to introduce User Sessions to this year’s event, as we believe that only by keeping your learning up to date and taking opportunities to try these new skills out for yourself in a safe environment, where it’s ok to fail - and fail fast - will you really be able to go back and implement the new knowledge you have acquired.

The Summit now includes these User Sessions, from working through Chaos Experiments to getting to grips with GDPR Patterns, from understanding how to use OWASP SAMM to using Pixi, we want to cover all the bases.
