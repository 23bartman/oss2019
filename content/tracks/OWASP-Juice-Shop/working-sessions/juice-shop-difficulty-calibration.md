## WHY

The Juice Shop offers almost 80 hacking challenges spread across 6
difficulty levels. It is time to revisit the latter for a consistency
check.

## What

* Present the results of the
  [Difficulty Calibration Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/rXil0RTdkhxKdf2J2)
* Discuss the need for more (or less?) difficulty levels
* Define criteria to map challenges to difficulties more easily (e.g.
  _"Scripting needed?"_ or _"Multi-step attack required?"_)
* Map the existing challenge to the aligned difficulty levels
