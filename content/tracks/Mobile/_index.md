Welome to the Owasp Mobile Security Testing Guide working-session track!

## WHY

The OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) project needs quiet some restructuring to be held up to date more efficiently. Next, With the rise of iOS 12 and Android 9, a lot of testcases need addendums and updates. This is what will be the core focus of this track.

## What

- Restructuring the MSTG
- Adding missing testcases and updating existing testcases of the MSTG.

Remember: the sessions will be content driven and are open to anyone. And we encourage both beginners as well as Subject Matter Experts to join. However, bare in mind that beginners will be facilitated by means of getting an issue assigned and having to research it (e.g.: learn by doing ;-)).
If you want to join our sessions, please make sure that:
- You have a laptop with you;
- You have a Github account; (need to refresh your git knowledge? check https://try.github.io/)

Having mobile devices with you is recommended, but not necessary. Want to do stuff for iOS? Bring something running Mac OS X and do bring something running iOS ;-).
