description  : Remember how we got the OWASP MSTG to life 2 years ago? Let's do this again! This time it is all about the restructuring of the MSTG and updating the testcases to the more recent Android and iOS versions. Remember: these sessions are about putting work in, they're no "free mobile security training". Come if you want to collaborate and join in on this marvelous project!
