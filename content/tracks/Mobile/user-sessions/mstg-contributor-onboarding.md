## Why

A take-off session for all participants that want to contribute to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide project, but are not sure what to do yet during this week or after.

## What

- Introduction into the current state of the MSTG.
  - [Issues](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues)
  - [Milestones](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/milestones)
  - [Project Page](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects)
- Release process.
- Contribution guidelines.
- Outline of the activities planned for this week.

This is **not** a basic introduction into the project itself! For this
we recommend to participate in the [Introduction into the MSTG](/tracks/Mboile/user-sessions/intro-mstg/) session!

## Who

Everyone that would like to start contributing to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide project.
