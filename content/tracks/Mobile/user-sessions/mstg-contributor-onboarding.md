## WHY

A take-off session for all participants that want to contribute to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide project, but are not sure what to do yet during this week or after.

## What

* Introduction into the current state of the MSTG
* Release proces
* Contribution guidelines
* Outline of the activities planned for this week

This is **not** a basic introduction into the project itself! For this
we recommend to participate in the [Introduction into the MSTG](/tracks/Mboile/user-sessions/intro-mstg/) session!
