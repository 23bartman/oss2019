Welcome to the OWASP MASVS session!

## Why

As part of the MSTG project we created the MASVS as a standard to establish baseline security requirements for mobile apps. In this working session we will go through the [open issues in Github](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues) and try to resolve and close as many as possible to come to a clean state.

## What

In this working session, we want to resolve the following:

- [Fix the Markdown issues](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/211)
- Find potential gaps with other mobile ressources and add them to the MASVS:
  - [ENISA Smartphone Guidelines](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/203)
  - [OWASP Mobile Security project](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/189)
- Verbalize new requirements:
   - [Location Related](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/131)
   - [Connectivy Related](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/132)
   - [Payload Encryption](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/133)
- [Create a category as in the OWASP Web Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/204)

If you are keen in doing some coding, you can help out with the following:

- [Generate JSON/XML](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/204)

The tickets for this working session will cover these topics and contribute to the restructuring of the MSTG [as described in this issue](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues/970). This should simplify the chapters, improve their readability and make the project a lot easier to maintain!

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- iOS developers
- Android developers
- Penetration Testers
- Security engineers

From experts to beginners. Anybody who is passionate about app mobile security and loves to continuously learn and enjoys sharing knowledge.

## What do you need to bring with you?

Minimum required: a laptop :)

The MASVS is hosted in GitHub and can easily be edited by anyone, just a Github account is needed and knowledge on how to create a pull request.

## Outcomes

A hopefully empty issue list :-)
