Welcome to the OWASP MASVS session!

## Why

As part of the MSTG project we created the MASVS as a standard to establish baseline security requirements for mobile apps. In this working session we will go through the [open issues in Github for milestone 1.1.4](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/milestone/3) and try to resolve and close as many as possible to come to a clean state.
The reason we do not want to come up with new requirements yet in a focused session, is because we rather first try to get the MSTG in sync, before we create a lot of new requirements.

## What

In this working session, we want to focus on issues identified in the 1.1.4 milestone of the MASVS. Which you can find at [Github](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/milestone/3 "Milestone 1.1.4"). Think of a variety of issues, such as:

- [Fix the Markdown issues](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/211)
- [Make sure we have the same code of conduct and contribution guide as the MSTG](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/212)

If you are keen in doing some coding, you can help out with the following:

- [Generate JSON/XML](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/204)
- [Ensure markdown validation automation](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/211)
- [Make sure gitbooks site shows all languages](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues/217)

The tickets for this working session will cover these topics and contribute to increasing the value, readability and extensability of the MASVS. Which in turn will make it easier to extend it across all languages.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- anyone who wants to help out improving the quality of an OWASP project and
- anybody interest in mobile security.

From experts to beginners. Anybody who is passionate about app mobile security and loves to continuously learn and enjoys sharing knowledge.

## What do you need to bring with you?

Minimum required: a laptop :)

The MASVS is hosted in GitHub and can easily be edited by anyone, just a Github account is needed and knowledge on how to create a pull request.

## Outcomes

Hopefully a better (en)coded MASVS! And milestone 1.1.4!
