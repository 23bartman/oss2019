Welcome to the ultimate Owasp Mobile Security Testing Guide content reshuffle session!

## WHY

Currently, we have 3 sections that are pretty distinct from each other: a global testing guide, an iOS testing guide and an Android testing guide. Keeping all 3 up to date makes stuff rather complicated! Let's simplify this as suggested in https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues/970! This should make the project a lot easier to maintain!

## What

Restructuring the MSTG as described in https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues/970.

## Outcomes

Hopefully a restructured MSTG.
