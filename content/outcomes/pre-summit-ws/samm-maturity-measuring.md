## Description of session

description  : The purpose of this session was to discuss 

## Outcomes/Deliverables 

...


The following are notes from the session - at this stage nothing was decided, rather a set of requirements were gathered to help aid and direct future conversations/ work in this space.

# Non-Technical Requirements







## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)
- TBD

## Identified Questions
- Where automation is utilised, how do we ensure we don't remove engineers abilities to learn from the threat modelling process, contribute and collaborate with security teams.
- By removing the manual process are we potentially missing threats captured from engineers contributions?
- How much data should be captured in a threat model? When is there too much data?
- What data shouldn't be in a threat model (assuming it's captured elswhere?)
- Should CVE's be present?
- Should SAST/ pen test output be present?

## Follow up
- TBD
