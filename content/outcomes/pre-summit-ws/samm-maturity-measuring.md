## Description of session

description  : The purpose of this session was to discuss measurement model aspects SAMM v2.0

## Outcomes/Deliverables 

...


The following are notes from the session - at this stage nothing was decided, rather a set of requirements were gathered to help aid and direct future conversations/ work in this space.

topics discussed:

should we measure "ownership" for the activities, practices? (RACI ?)

how about applicability (not all practices / activities are applicable)
model aims to be agnostic of process, technology or type of organisation

benchmarking, comparing aspects of the measurement.
ahead or behind "the pack"
objectices versus actual state

track in a graph database?
