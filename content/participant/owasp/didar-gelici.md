sessions        : 
Track - PSD2 and GDPR 
1. Working session - Using Threat Models for GDPR
2. User sesion - Using graphs for GDPR mappings and visualisations  
Track - CISO
1. Working session - OWASP COLLECTIVE DEFENCE CLUSTER (CDC) - TWO YEARS ON  
I think either this session needs to include third arty risk or a separate session. Third party due diligence is run by every company in a different way, a mre centralised forum for sharing assessments and de-duplicating the efforts (for both the service provider and the receiver side) needed throughout all industries.

Didar has 10+ years in total spent cross all three lines of defence for Information Security Risk. 
Started in IT Audit, moved into risk and governance. Mainly served in financial institutions and regulated environments.

Pet peeves are ineffective third party risk management practices and ignored data privacy right of humans.
