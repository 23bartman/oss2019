Welome to the Owasp Mobile Security Testing Guide Content pressure cook!


## WHY

Ever since iOS 12 and Android 8/9 came out, a lot of security fixes have been added by the vendors! This means new parameters that need explaining (AND VERIFICATION ;-)). So we need to start hacking on our mobile devices, learn from them and update / fix the issues! Next to that, are tons of other issues that still don't have a PR. Are you interested in the kind of content we need to work on during these days? Check https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues!

Next, the OMTG playground and the ios crackme's really needs some TLC, so we need to update them, so it runs on Android 9 as well!

## What

- Fix issues mentioned in https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues and update the iOS materials as well.
- Fix the OMTG (and automate the builds, similar to the crackmes)
- Fix the iOS Crackme's (fix lvl2 and create lvl3)
